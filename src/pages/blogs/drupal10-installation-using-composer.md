Drupal 8 onwards it is preety much clear now that Drupal has adopted the standard php development practises and this is followed by all the latest release of Drupal like Drupal 9 and Drupal 10.

Hence by now it should be understood that to use Drupal, drupal developers needs to know few tools and technologies to smoothly carry out their drupal development task/projects. This new addition of tools does add a little extra effort initially to learn, but I am sure later this is going to make your life so so easy when it comes to major version upgrades.

Hence here in this article we are going to talk about this tools and how we can use them from installing Drupal to start customising drupal with custom module, theme developments.

So lets start with the list of tools needed .

1. Composer 2.0 and above
2. Drush 11 and above
3. Lando (Optional)
